# Promillerechner

A simple C# (CSharp) Console App exercise project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz + Grub Academy.  
It calculates the user's estimated blood alcohol level based on the amount of beer consumed and body weight.

The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Promillerechner.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0/".*

*Note: German language used.*
